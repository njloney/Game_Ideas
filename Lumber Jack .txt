Game starts in a mega city, cyberpunkish where your a coporate worker but your huge, like mr incredible in the office scene, you come home to find your wife and daughter missing, and your home completely destroyed and covered in blood, montage goes by of you quiting, looking for your family, eventually giving up due to there being no more leads. you pack your things and move to an old remote village near a mountain, you live in a log cabin you built on the mountain, remote even from the village, with nothing but your axe that you found when you left the city every day you wander into the forest of huge cedar trees and cut one down peecefully, you always choose one near the end of its life and thank it after you have felled it, you drag it back to the cabin and begin chopping it into small pieces for fire wood while admiring the view of nothing but nature. The next morning you wake up the the smell of smoke, as you look over the once peaceful view you notice mechanical monstrocities on the horizon moving towards the village, by time you make it to the foot of the mountain the village had already been overun, and the mechanical beast have started to chop away at the peacful cedar forest. you quietly make your way back to the cabin and begin to pack and move once again, however you relised that you have left your axe in the forest, you quickly run to retrieve the axe from deep within the forest, when you finally stuble across the axe, it seems to have been repaired and the handle seems to have more decorative pieces that before, some of the handle even seems to be glowing gold. As soon as you lay your hands on the axe you start to hear a singing coming from the front of the village, as you make your way towards the voice to warn them of whats to come, your peak through bushes to see what it was that was singing, just to se a tree slightly radiating,  as you begin to approach you hear the loud buzz of a giant machine, like the tree destryoers from avatar the movie, and you watch as the machine completly destroys your once beloved forest, as you remose of all the peaceful times the forest has given you, you see a figure appear infront of the machine, it seems to be a yound lady, she looks remarkably like your daughter and wife as she returns to the machine she seems over joyed that she had finally found something, then you look down and part of the axe that had been glowing gold before seems to become darker as one of the voices of the forest has dissapeared.

That was the basic rundown of the story

I want the MC to fight basically different types of forest killing machines and get stronger with the axe, in a 2d platformer kind of like katana 0, however no matter how perfect you complete the fights eventually the entire forest will be destroyed and the axe handle will crumble, this will then lead you to start the final boss fight of the game with the girl you saw and the tree destroyer at the start of the game, the battle field being the felled forest, when you triumph over the difficult boss you will somehow (i dont know how) see that the lady seems to be a clone of your daughter, with this new lead and the forest being destroyed you head back to the city with just your axe head in hand. that would be the end of the first game

Im thinking that there will be 5 powers corresponding to 5 golden trees that you help throughout the game, the first power would come from the tree you see felled during the cutscene and after the cutscene the power is weakened, leaving it to be later awakened when all the other trees power is embued in the axe, however everytime you save a tree the last tree you save dies, this eventully leads to the destruction of the forest.
