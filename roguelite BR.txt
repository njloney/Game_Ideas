Basic Idea:

A battle royale were when you play a match during the match you recieve passive buffs to find and pick up like items and at the end of the match if you win, you would be able to select one of the buffs to keep on your character permentley or if you have a buff you can level it up, when loading into a match you can select 3 buffs to have equipped. Everyone would start with 3 basic buffs, and by accomplishing different things in a BR match it would be possible to aquire new buffs or level up old ones. this game would have seasons, and when season reset I think you should lose all buffs you have except for one of your choosing.
