Fallen Star(place holder), 
Game where you play as a constellation(essentially a god) that at the star of the game lost their powers due to other constellations ganging up on them. Cutscene could include like you chained up hanging while they have like the ending of a trail where they break your weapon(most likely a sword) and scatter your stars/stardust(skills or like spells or sword skills), goal of the game is to repair your sword and retrieve your stars, repairing the sword would have to do with fighting 5 different bosses each dropping a part of the shattered blade(you start with the hilt) and watch time you get a price of the blade your weapon becomes stronger(5 or so boss fights maybe less), retrieving your stars would be another set of boss fights each of the bosses using one of the skills you lost beating them gives im them back, these 2 types of bosses can either alternate or you can fight either a blade boss or a star boss(like one of each are on the map and you can go to one to fight( or maybe even all the star bosses spawn in the map at the start and you have to find them while each of the sword bosses spawn at a certain completion percentage)) and after you gather all your previous skills and blade pieces you fight a boss rush of the constellations that stripped you of your powers each of them can drop either like an upgrade for the blade or a new skill or like an item that gives a passive. The bosses could be constellation themed, and the skills could be space themed
I just wrote what popped into head
Idk if u understand what I was thinking
Also I canâ€™t sleep now cause all I can think about is what the character would look like
And like you know how some constellations have like a backstory with other if there were constellations that like killed each other or some shit or hated each other what if we named the star bosses after one of them and the skill the previous boss dropped another so it was like you get the tool to kill them or some shit
And the skill could be really useful lint their specific fight

there would be an optional item system where you could go around the map collecting items by like puzzles or secret areas or bosses, these items would be upgradable at the forge with there own skill tree's(the place where you go to fix sword)

Biomes -
Abyss (sub area Void)
Nebula (sub area Star Cluster)
Ruined Stadium(run down gladiator dome in the middle of the map, where the Blade fights take place)
Milky Way(the area in which we fall to, reason being is that orion lies in the milky way galaxy)
??????ngc 1275(a black hole located at the corner of the map hidden, this is where perseus will reside chained in the blackhole for all eternity because of his sins against the gods)
Kuiper Belt ( and asteriod belt close the the milkyway on the map could go in a small loop around the entire map given the it is a donut asteriod belt)



15 bosses in total, 5 blade bosses(progression based), 5 star bosses(disorganized), final 4 boss rush plus 1 champion after you fight all the blade bosses and star bosses
